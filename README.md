This repository demonstrates a common Python error: TypeError in a function that calculates the average of numbers.  The `calculate_average` function initially lacks error handling for cases where the input list contains non-numeric data types. This results in a TypeError when attempting to perform arithmetic operations on strings and integers together.  The solution provides a robust and corrected version of the function.
